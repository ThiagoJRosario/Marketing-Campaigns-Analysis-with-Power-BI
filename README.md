# Marketing-Campaigns-Analysis-with-Power-BI

This project provides an introduction to the analysis of marketing campaigns using Power BI, with a practical and hands-on approach. Over the course of this mini-project, four dashboards are created, using more than ten different visual elements, customizations, data formatting, and corrections. The dataset used is fictional and provided by Data Science Academy.

The dataset simulates information about customers and marketing campaigns conducted by a company. The objective is to create comprehensive reports that offer insights into various key areas:

Customer Overview: Understanding customer demographics and segmentation.
Customer Purchase Behavior: Analyzing patterns and trends in customer purchases.
Marketing Campaign Performance: Measuring the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns.
Purchase Patterns at Point of Sale (Country Level): Identifying purchasing behavior across different geographical regions.
In each section, we explore relevant variables, create visuals, calculate measures, extract metrics, and cross-analyze the data. The goal is to provide decision-makers with a clear and actionable view of customer profiles, purchasing trends, and the overall success of marketing efforts.
